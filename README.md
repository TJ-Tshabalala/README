# About Me
Hi, I’m Tity Tshabalala. I currently work as an Operations Assistant at 4Sight Holdings , where I focus on streamlining data governance, managing master data, and supporting employee and customer onboarding within our ERP system.

While my current professional experience is in operations, I am actively transitioning into Cloud and DevOps Engineering. I have already built a strong technical foundation by earning several key certifications, including Azure Developer Associate , and Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions. I am now focused on deepening my hands-on knowledge of Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD pipelines.

What sets me apart is the 'operational reliability' mindset I bring from my current role , which I am now applying to technical automation and Python scripting. My unique value lies in my ability to bridge the gap between business processes and technical infrastructure to ensure system stability.

My goal is to secure a role within a Cloud or DevOps team where I can grow my technical skills while contributing to the efficiency and scalability of the infrastructure. I’d love to hear about the technologies your team is currently prioritizing.

## Personal:
I am learning everything __cloud__, as my career goal is to become a multi-cloud specialist.
I am currently learning through [learn2cloud](https://learntocloud.guide/).
I also have a desire and a passion for Fullstack Development, and have a course on
__Quantum Computing__ that I am looking to complete before the end of __2027__.

I enjoy:
* Coding -> (_Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure), Quantum Computing_ 💻)
* Gaming -> (_Call of Duty Mobile_)
* Football -> (_Favourite team is **Manchester United**_ ⚽)
* Anime  -> (_Favourite anime is **Bleach**, followed by **Yu Yu Hakusho**_ 📺)
* Learning -> (There is fun to be had in learning new, fun fact: _The human's brain storage capacity is around **2.5 petabytes**, that's 25 **Million Gigabytes** worth of information_ so why not use it 😄)

It is an interesting and fun journey that I am undertaking (just wanted to use that word).
